Check for keywords that warn against accidents on my commute

## What
This app runs on Heroku twice a day, before I begin my drive to and from work.

The app searches twitter for a number of tweets within a set period of time.

If the results meet the parameters, the app emails me to warn me and I will either work from home, plan another route or work later that day.
